# Experimental Agent Runtime

This nested workspace is isolated from stable Robdex. It is not a member of the
main backend workspace and is not wired into supervisor, the stable bridge, the
stable database, or the GUI.

## Database

The runtime requires host PostgreSQL. Configure the connection with:

```sh
export ROBDEX_AGENT_RUNTIME_DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/robdex_agent_runtime'
```

Initialize the schema:

```sh
robdex-agent-runtime init-db
```

Use local host Postgres for all experimental runtime state.

## Model adapter boundary

Runtime code depends on the local `ModelClient` trait. The current adapter is
`model::codex_adapter::CodexBackedModelClient`, an experimental direct
Responses adapter that performs HTTPS calls to the ChatGPT Codex Responses
endpoint with Codex auth material from the local environment or `auth.json`.
It does not claim to use the full vendored Codex provider/client runtime. All
direct HTTP, Responses request shaping, Codex auth headers, SSE parsing, and raw
model response handling must stay inside `model::codex_adapter`.

## Script output

Starlark scripts emit final tool output only through:

```python
output(value)
```

Host API calls return values to the script, but they do not implicitly append to
the final tool output. This keeps tool result packets deterministic and concise.

## Role policy foundation

Postgres is the runtime source of truth for roles. JSON manifests and prompt files in `roles/` are seed/import/export artifacts only. Import resolves prompt files into immutable `role_versions.instruction_text`; runtime session creation reads the current DB role version and stores a complete immutable `sessions.role_snapshot`.

Active actions implemented by this slice:
- `tool.execute_code`
- `fs.read`
- `cmd.rg.run`
- `fs.write`
- `patch.apply`
- `cmd.git.status`
- `cmd.git.diff`
- `cmd.cargo.check`

Reserved future action names documented but not implemented here:
- `agent.spawn.<role>`
- `agent.archive`
- `requirements.set.self`
- `requirements.set.other`
- `requirements.change.active`
- `message.send`
- `message.route`

Manifest decision values are `allow`, `deny`, `ownerApproval`, and `orchestratorApproval`. Runtime policy maps approval decisions to `approvalRequired` and does not execute those actions in this task. Missing action policy defaults to deny. Policy is execution authority; `capabilities` are validated to exactly match policy keys so they cannot contradict enforcement. Sessions store immutable role snapshots at creation time; turns use the stored snapshot rather than rereading the latest manifest. The direct Responses adapter receives the model name and instruction text from the session snapshot. Reasoning effort is stored in the DB role version and snapshot but is not applied by the current direct adapter yet.

## Approval and routing foundation

Approval-required policy decisions are durable kernel objects. When a role policy uses `ownerApproval` or `orchestratorApproval`, runtime policy returns `approvalRequired`, records `policy.decision`, creates an `approval_requests` row with the required approver kind, records `approval.requested`, and blocks the action. The runtime does not auto-approve and does not resume blocked actions after a decision in this phase. CLI inspection and persistence are available through `approvals list`, `approvals show <id>`, and `approvals decide <id> --decision approved|denied --reason <text>`; decisions record `approval.decided` only.

Routing metadata is structured role data. The supported mode is `direct`, with `defaultRecipient` and `allowedRecipients`. Recipients may be reserved principals such as `owner` and `orchestrator` or DB-canonical role IDs. Import-time validation uses existing DB roles plus seed/import context, so newly imported role IDs can be referenced without Rust code changes. Route evaluation records `route.decision`; no multi-agent message delivery is implemented in this phase.

## Action-only approval resume

Approval resume is explicit and action-only. `approvals decide` only persists a decision and never executes the blocked action. `approvals resume <approval-id>` requires an approved request and a linked pending paused action. Resumable actions use immutable stored input for `cmd.rg.run`, `fs.write`, `patch.apply`, `cmd.git.status`, `cmd.git.diff`, and `cmd.cargo.check`. Resume does not call the model, does not replay the script or turn, and does not rewrite the original failed turn. Resume records `approval.resume.started`, `policy.resumeDecision`, mutation/command evidence, and `approval.resume.completed` or `approval.resume.failed`.

## Validation database hygiene

Manual experiments use the normal runtime database configured by `ROBDEX_AGENT_RUNTIME_DATABASE_URL`, for example:

```sh
export ROBDEX_AGENT_RUNTIME_DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/robdex_agent_runtime'
```

Validation scripts do not use that database by default. Scripts under `scripts/validate-*.sh` create a per-run isolated Postgres database whose name starts with `robdex_agent_runtime_validation_`, point `ROBDEX_AGENT_RUNTIME_DATABASE_URL` at that temporary database for the script process, and drop the temporary database on exit. Cleanup runs on success and failure.

Run validation scripts from the nested workspace:

```sh
scripts/validate-db-canonical-roles.sh
scripts/validate-approvals-routing.sh
scripts/validate-action-resume.sh
scripts/validate-mutation-actions.sh
```

Validation database administration defaults to `ROBDEX_AGENT_RUNTIME_VALIDATION_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres`. Override that admin connection only when the same local Postgres server requires a different maintenance database. Do not point validation cleanup at the normal runtime database.

If cleanup fails, the script prints the leftover validation database name, admin connection, and exact manual cleanup SQL. Manual cleanup must only target names with the strict validation prefix:

```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS "robdex_agent_runtime_validation_<run_id>" WITH (FORCE);
```

The cleanup helper refuses destructive cleanup for database names that do not start with `robdex_agent_runtime_validation_`.
