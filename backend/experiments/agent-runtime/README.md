# Experimental Agent Runtime

This nested workspace is isolated from stable Robdex. It is not a member of the
main backend workspace and is not wired into supervisor, the stable bridge, the
stable database, or the GUI.

## Database

The runtime requires host PostgreSQL. Configure the connection with:

```sh
export ROBDEX_AGENT_RUNTIME_DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/robdex_agent_runtime'
```

Initialize the schema:

```sh
robdex-agent-runtime init-db
```

Use local host Postgres for all experimental runtime state.

## Model adapter boundary

Runtime code depends on the local `ModelClient` trait. The current adapter is
`model::codex_adapter::CodexBackedModelClient`, an experimental direct
Responses adapter that performs HTTPS calls to the ChatGPT Codex Responses
endpoint with Codex auth material from the local environment or `auth.json`.
It does not claim to use the full vendored Codex provider/client runtime. All
direct HTTP, Responses request shaping, Codex auth headers, SSE parsing, and raw
model response handling must stay inside `model::codex_adapter`.

## Script output

Starlark scripts emit final tool output only through:

```python
output(value)
```

Host API calls return values to the script, but they do not implicitly append to
the final tool output. This keeps tool result packets deterministic and concise.

## Role policy foundation

Experimental roles are file-backed JSON manifests in `roles/`. A role manifest defines prompt source, model defaults, active action policy, routing metadata, visibility metadata, and lifecycle authority metadata. The kernel owns the finite action catalog; role prose does not create powers.

Active actions implemented by this slice:
- `tool.execute_code`
- `fs.read`
- `cmd.rg.run`

Reserved future action names documented but not implemented here:
- `agent.spawn.<role>`
- `agent.archive`
- `requirements.set.self`
- `requirements.set.other`
- `requirements.change.active`
- `message.send`
- `message.route`

Manifest decision values are `allow`, `deny`, `ownerApproval`, and `orchestratorApproval`. Runtime policy maps approval decisions to `approvalRequired` and does not execute those actions in this task. Missing action policy defaults to deny. Sessions store immutable role snapshots at creation time; turns use the stored snapshot rather than rereading the latest manifest.
